The headliner of the first event from NEOPLASM 
was an American artist Eartheater (Alexandra Dryuchin) â€” 
an artist of the Berlin label PAN. 
Born on a farm in Pennsylvania in a family of a Soviet immigrant artist and 
horse breeder, she mixes acoustic instruments 
with electronic percussion and synthesizers. 
Eartheater music ignores the norms of beauty and 
traditional musical language. Over the past few years, 
she has become a prominent figure in contemporary art galleries and 
major music festivals. 
Eartheater was performing in Moscow in the Live 8 Club on October 8 
and performed with the residents of NEOPLASM.
