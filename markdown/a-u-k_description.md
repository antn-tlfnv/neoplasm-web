Neoplasm releases a new work named "A U K" by the St. Petersburg sound and video designer Our.V. First works of Our.V were associated with video production, but since 2016, he has been engaged in sound design of video materials, creating images enclosed in sound. His new work is an audio dystopia in which the listener experiences the consequences of an information overabundance. This is an attempt to find a way out of the information overload environment, which eventually leads to a distance from the goal itself. The work explores the fixation of facets, passing beyond which escapism ceases to be a means of avoiding neurosis and becomes the goal of existence.
