On February 29, the second event from the Neoplasm collective will be held in Live8 Club. It will be headlined by Berlin-based electronic producer HDMIRROR. The key idea of HDMIRROR is to bring the energy of the Gabber and trance genres to the limit of their possible impact on the listener. Over the past few years, he has managed to play at some events with Lotic, Amnesia Scanner, Bill Kouligas, Flora Yin Wong, and one of the highlights for him was a performance at the gabber-hardcore event CTM-Adrenalin in Berghain with Marc Acardipane, HAJ300 and KABLAM. 

HDMIRROR has regular broadcasts on NTS London radio and Rinse FM.

The event will also be important for the Neoplasm because of the release named "A U K" by the St. Petersburg sound and video designer Our.V. First works of Our.V were associated with video production, but since 2016, he has been engaged in sound design of video materials, creating images enclosed in sound. His new work is an audio dystopia in which the listener experiences the consequences of an information overabundance. This is an attempt to find a way out of the information overload environment, which eventually leads to a distance from the goal itself. The work explores the fixation of facets, passing beyond which escapism ceases to be a means of avoiding neurosis and becomes the goal of existence.

The event will sell merch, which he released in collaboration with Neoplasm.

P3RF X, ALEXA1312, and ducttape sets will complement the event's lineup.
