A physical copy of the Marble Bust album, Lifeoxetine, is a MiniDisc with an NFC-chip, which gives access to additional Neoplasm content and automatically adds the user to a closed community.

After scanning the NFC-tag, you get:

1. Archive with stems of all compositions from the Lifeoxetine for your remixes.
2. Access to my closed community on Telergram.
