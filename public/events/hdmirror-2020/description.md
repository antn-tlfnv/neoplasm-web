On February&nbsp;29, the second event from the NEOPLASM collective 
will be held in Live8Club. 
It will be headlined by Berlin-based electronic producer HDMIRROR. 
The key idea of HDMIRROR is to bring the energy of the Gabber and 
trance genres to the limit of their possible impact on the listener. 
Over the past few years, he has managed to play at some events 
with Lotic, Amnesia Scanner, Bill Kouligas, Flora Yin Wong, 
and one of the highlights for him was a performance at the gabber-hardcore event 
CTM-Adrenalin in Berghain with Marc Acardipane, HAJ300 and KABLAM. 

HDMIRROR has regular broadcasts on NTS London radio and Rinse FM.

The event will also be important for the NEOPLASM 
because of the release named "A&nbsp;U&nbsp;K" 
by the St.&nbsp;Petersburg sound and video designer Our.V. 
First works of Our.V were associated with video production, 
but since 2016, he has been engaged in sound design of video materials, 
creating images enclosed in sound. 

His new work is an audio dystopia 
in which the listener experiences the consequences 
of an information overabundance. This is an attempt 
to find a way out of the information overload environment, 
which eventually leads to a distance from the goal itself. 
The work explores the fixation of facets, passing beyond 
which escapism ceases to be a means of avoiding neurosis 
and becomes the goal of existence.

The event will sell merch, 
which he released in collaboration with NEOPLASM.

P3RF&nbsp;X, ALEXA1312, and ducttape sets will complement the event's lineup.
